            <h2> Discovery:</h2>
            <p style= "font-size :18px;">The concept of particle accelerators emerged in the early 20th century with the development of cyclotrons and synchrotrons.
            In 1928, Ernest Rutherford, during  <br>his presidential address to the Royal Society of London, expressed the need for a beam of charged particles more energetic than those produced by natural radioactivity.</p>

        <div id="history">
            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p style= "font-size :18px;">Particle accelerators have evolved significantly since their inception, contributing to major scientific discoveries.
                Accelerators use electromagnetic fields to accelerate <br> and steer particles. Radiofrequency cavities boost the particle beams, while magnets focus the beams and bend their trajectory. In a circular accelerator, the particles <br>repeat the same circuit for as long as necessary, getting an energy boost at each turn.</p>

        <div id="accidents">
            <h2>Accidents:</h2>
            <p style= "font-size :18px;">While rare, accidents such as the one involving Anatoli Bugorski have occurred, highlighting the importance of safety measures. Anatoli Bugorski was a Russian physicist <br> working at the Institute for High Energy Physics on an accelerator called the U-70 synchrotron . In 1978, he stuck his head inside the tube in order to diagnose a problem,<br> when a safety mechanism failed, and the particle beam hit him in the head.</p>

        <div id="science-fiction">
            <h2>Science Fiction vs Reality:</h2> 
            <p style= "font-size :18px;">In science fiction, particle accelerators often appear as powerful weapons or gateways to other dimensions, which is a stark contrast to their real-life scientific applications. 
                In science fiction, particle accelerators often serve as portals to other dimensions, tools for time travel, or sources of immense energy for futuristic weapons. They are sometimes 
                 depicted as integral to the creation of artificial intelligence or advanced robotics. However, in reality, particle accelerators are primarily used for fundamental particle research, aiding scientists in understanding the universe at its most fundamental level. They also find practical applications in medicine, such as in cancer treatment through radiation therapy, and contribute to materials science research, helping develop new materials with unique properties. Additionally, some accelerators are utilized in nuclear energy research, exploring 
                potential applications for clean and sustainable energy sources like nuclear fusion.</p>
